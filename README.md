# Daily Realtor

This is a script for my mom to send her new Realtor.com
listings in nearby locations every day.

## Setup

Set up a config file. See [config.example.json](config.example.json)
Create a copy of this file named `config.json`. You can now run

```bash
# install uv
# https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

uv run main.py
```
