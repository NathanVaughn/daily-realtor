# Daily Realtor

This is a script for my mom to send her new Realtor.com
listings in nearby locations every day.

## Setup

```bash
python -m pip install pip wheel --upgrade
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, you need to set up a config file. See [config.example.json](config.example.json)
Create a copy of this file named `config.json`. You can now run

```bash
python main.py
```
